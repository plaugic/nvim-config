-- Configuration for various utility plugins

-- Example: Configuring 'Comment.nvim' for easy commenting
require('Comment').setup({
    -- Uncomment and set options here for Comment.nvim if you have specific preferences
    -- For example, toggling comment styles, pre-hook/post-hook functions, etc.
})

-- Add configurations for any other utility plugins you used in your original setup here
-- Example for another utility plugin:
